## 📌 The Problem: Recruitment Crisis

Recruiters face a storm of challenges:
- **250+ applications per role** bury teams in resumes.
- **23 hours per hire** wasted on manual screening.
- **75% of qualified candidates** overlooked due to bias or volume.
- **$14,900 average cost** of a bad hire ([SHRM, 2024](https://www.shrm.org/)).

**Business Impact:**  
42 days to fill a role ⏳ | $500 daily vacancy costs 💸 | 60% candidate drop-off 📉

## 🕳️ The Gap: Outdated & Biased Hiring

Traditional tools fail with:
- **Keyword-based screening** that misses true potential.
- **Manual processes** prone to unconscious bias.
- **Poor candidate experience** leading to talent loss.
